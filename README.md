============

Exploit implementation of
[CVE-2018-4386](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1665).
Obtains addrof/fakeobj and arbitrary read/write primitives.

Supports PS4 consoles on 6.XX. May also work on older firmware versions,
but I am not sure. Bug was fixed in firmware 7.00.
